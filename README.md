## Project Description
* The purpose of this project is to predict the sentiment of user's review.
* The data has been taken from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sid321axn/amazon-alexa-reviews
* Multinomial Naive Bayes has been used to perform sentiment analysis in this project.
* MLFlow has been integerated into this project for model tracking purposes.
* Model evaluation component contains the MLFlow integeration.

## Getting Started

1. Raw Data is kept in [data\archive (2).zip].

2. Data Ingestion scripts are kept in [src\sanbproject\components\data_ingestion.py]
    
3. Data transformation scripts are kept in [src\sanbproject\components\data_transformation.py]

4. Model training scripts are kept in [src\sanbproject\components\model_trainer.py]

5. Model evaluation scripts are kept in [src\sanbproject\components\model_eval.py]

## Featured Notebooks/Analysis/Deliverables
* [src\sanbproject\pipeline\prediction_pipeline.py] is the prediction pipeline that is responsible for performing model predictions.
* [src\sanbproject\pipeline\training_pipeline.py] is the training pipeline that is responsible for training the model.
